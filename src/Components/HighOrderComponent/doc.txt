A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. 
A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

Syntax:-
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

const SkilledStudent = withIntern(Student) {training}
const SkilledStudent = (Student)=> {training}
